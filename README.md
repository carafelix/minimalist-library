## Learnt

- Do not build a feature (in this case was a function to retrieve the house object internals) without having finished the actual object it consumes 

## todo
- integrate bit.ly for long url
- integrate imgur for img hosting
- add ability to log custom books
- active background should expand to the wold librarie sub-div to not exclude the delete bin
- fix parse house functions
    - change how the House object is initialize, not to store the whole object but to just parse it storage and a stringify version of its contents???
    - Parsing them into a new House instance should be done via the (...) operator.
